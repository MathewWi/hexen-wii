## What is Hexen Wii? ##
Hexen is a simply astounding open source FPS from Raven Software (part of id Software) set in a medieval fantasy world. With three different playable characters and RPG elements, Hexen is unlike anything else. This project aims to create a fully working version of Hexen through a port of the HHexen engine for use on the Nintendo Wii via homebrew.
